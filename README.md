## Generate Documentation

The following tools are required to generate the documentation:
 - **doxygen.exe**  Version: 1.8.2 (Documentation Generator)
 - **mscgen.exe**   Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)

Using these tools, documentation can be generated under Windows
with the batch file **genDoc.bat** in directory CMSIS/DoxyGen/.

The file CMSIS/DoxyGen/How2Doc.txt describes the rules for creating API
documentation.
