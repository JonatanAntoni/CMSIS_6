The \ref device_h_pg contains the following sections that are device specific:
 - \ref irqn_defs provides interrupt numbers (IRQn) for all exceptions and interrupts of the device.
 - \ref config_perifs reflect the features of the device.
 - \ref access_perifs definitions for the \ref peripheral_gr to all device peripherals. It contains all data structures and the address mapping for device-specific peripherals.
 - <b>Access Functions for Peripherals (optioal)</b> provide additional helper functions for peripherals that are useful for programming of these peripherals. Access Functions may be provided as inline functions or can be extern references to a device-specific library provided by the silicon vendor.
